# MPhil
This repository contains back-ups of my R Scripts and outputs

My JNU CESP MPhil thesis was on higher education financing and the privatisation of universities, focusing specifically on the implications of different student loan models into India. Using Periodic Labour Force Survey data from 2016-2018 I implemented Lorraine Dearden's novel copula-method of simulating movement across percentiles for earners as they transition through their work life. 

The scripts in this repository are all the files I've used so far to import the PLFS data, clean it, generate the necessary parameters of the model, construct simulations for different loan structures, and produce graphs for the same. 

I have additionally committed some other R-scripts that related to this project including a script intended to scrape data from NIRF's ranking framework, clean it, and generate information on self-reported expenditure headings. This line of research ultimately did not pan out so I abandoned it. 


Note: the code is largely spaghetti and has not been cleaned for public usage/reproducibility yet. I have a long-term intention to address this.
